Blip is a templating language for Go. 
It works by transpiling templates into pure Go and including them at compile time. 
These templates are light wrappers around the Go language itself.  

Benefits:

* Very Fast rendering 
* Compile time type checking,  Type safe!
* Template Extending / Including
* Simple syntax
* Auto-Escaping
* Support passing variables directly and via context
* Extendable escaping / monitoring

Cons:

* Not a dynamic template, will require transpiling and recompiling.
  * blip can watch the project and transpile automatically.
  * air can be used to auto restart applications
