Blip - Go Templates

The intent is to create template html files with go code included.
A conversion step with convert these to go file with the name of the template
and a process() function.

The process function takes arguments as specified in the template.

===========
Example:  hello.gte
@arg name string

// Records this as input to the template
@context name User
Note that if the "name" is not placed in the context then the render
@context name User = some initial value
In this case if "name" is not passed in, it will retain the initial value.


<h1>@= name@</h1>

converts to:

var hello1 []byte = []byte("<h1>")
var hello2 []byte = []byte("</h1>\n")
func Hello(name string, w io.Writer) error {
	w.Write(hello1)
	w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprint(name)))
	w.Write(hello2)
	return nil
}

Benefits:
* compile time type checking
* run time performance

=========
template commands.

@arg specifies an argument to the template
@// Single line comment
@* multiline comment
*@

// standard output (noescaping)
@== foo@
> fmt.Print(foo)

// Safe html output (escape output)
@= foo @
@= foo.method(blah)@  <-transform to below.
  > fmt.Print(  html.EscapeString( foo.method(blah)) )

// Writes the same as ItoA
@int= intValue @


Call into another template and pass contents.
!! What about arguments !!
@include templateName arg1, arg2 @ <-- .. no content added .. simple include
  -- Note after template name the args are embedded as is


@extend templateName arg1, arg2 {@
    -- Note after template name the args are embedded as is
    @content positionName {@
        Some content to include

        @include templateName {@
            Nested capabilities
            Some content to include
        @}

    @}

@}

Embeddable template
@yield positionName @
Translates to a function call

if position name is not presented by the caller it will not produce anything.





Note the expression must convert to a string
@import  go import to be injected

@{
    full code block ... will be embedded in the result
    use w for writing to actually produce some output.
    The si variable can be used to call helper functions
@}

@func
define a full function in here. It will be embedded as is at the end of the file.
@}
ex:
@func
func toUpper(str string) string {
    return strings.ToUpper(str)
}
@}

======= Additional features =======
Note:  Most commands are expected to end on the same line and will return errors if not.
Ex:
@extend name args {@
...


=== Conditional support ===
@if .. go expression {@
template content
@else
template content
@endif

=== Looping construct ===
@for error in errors {@
    // for idx, error := range errors {
@endfor
    // }
